				<p>This semester in college I joined the board for the Pre-Medical Chapter of the American Women's Medical Association (AMWA) at USC as an Events Committee Representative. Our club's mission is to foster a strong community of female pre-medical students and support them on their journey to becoming future healthcare practioner through various professional, academic, social, philanthropy, and volunteering events. Some of the events that my Event Committee Board have came up with this semester include a "Moms in Medicine" panel, Mask Making Event Social, Keck Medical Student panel, Linkedin Workshop, Stress Management Workshop, Advisement Workshop, and A discussion regarding disparities within healthcare in collaboration with African Americans in Health at USC (some of the event flyers below!). In collaboration with other Committees on the Board, AMWA has worked with Cards For Courage to make cards for Health Care Workers amidst COVID-19 and fundraised for Making Strides Against Breast CancerÂ®, Armenian Fund, Medics in Armenia, and Black Lives Matter. I can't wait for the many more events to plan in the upcoming semester with my lovely ladies in STEM.</p>

				<p>For the past 4 semesters at USC, I have been a memember of Science Outreach (SCout). SCout has been one of my favorite clubs to participate in because we get to do science experiments with second and third graders once a week with a small group of around eight other USC SCout members. Some of the experiments we do with the students include making oobleck, elephant toothpaste, strawberry DNA and lava lamps, and also doing experiments that involve dry ice, invisible marbles, and seeds. The students are always excited to do these fun experiments, which makes me happy to know that I can spark an excitement for science, exploration, and learning in the classroom. Although this semester has switched to online, our team was still able to adapt and be able to teach the students the same experiments and get them excited for each lesson. Hopefully the efforts I put into the students translates into inspiring them to become future mini scientists! Also, above is a picture of some of the SCout members dressed up on Halloween this semester!

				<p>Alpha Phi Omega (APO) is a National Service Organization at USC where I found some of my closest friends in colleges and have shared the most memorable memories with. In APO, we bond through doing service events together such as at the Los Angeles Food Bank, Watt's Empowerment Center, Hollywood Food Coalition, and Share a Meal, as well as through other fun social events such as going on food adventures, cookie decorating, and exercising. This semester, I became the Vice President of Communications for APO, which has allowed me to take on a more active role in APO and see the administrative side behind planning events and running the organization. My role consisted of ensuring constant communication between the member and the executive board and running APO's social media. Everyone I have met in APO have all been super friendly, approachable, and fun, making it always a blast whenever I get a chance to hang out with them. Being in APO has made USC's big campus feel a lot smaller because I always see a friendly face on campus wherever I go, and I can't wait to have more memories with them in the future, even beyond college as life long friends.
